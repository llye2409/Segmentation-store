    Welcome to the **Modeling** section of the **RFM Clustering App**. This section is where you will build machine learning models using the customer segments you've created through the RFM analysis. Modeling helps predict customer behavior and classify customers into different groups, allowing you to make data-driven decisions for marketing strategies.
    
    Below, we will guide you on how to use the modeling section effectively.

    # Steps to perform Modeling
    st.header("Steps to Perform Modeling")
    
    st.write("""
    To perform modeling, follow these steps:
    
    1. **Select Your Customer Segments**:
        - First, you need to segment your customers based on their RFM scores. You can choose the segments that you want to analyze further.
        - The customer segments typically include groups such as "Loyal", "Regular", "At-risk", and "No Potential".

    2. **Choose a Modeling Algorithm**:
        - We offer several machine learning algorithms to help you build predictive models:
            - **K-means Clustering**: This unsupervised algorithm helps group customers into clusters based on RFM attributes.
            - **Decision Trees**: A supervised learning method to classify customers into different categories based on their behavior.
            - **Random Forest**: An ensemble method that improves the accuracy of decision trees by combining multiple trees.
            - **Logistic Regression**: A statistical method to predict the probability of customer behaviors, such as purchasing decisions.
            
        - Choose the algorithm that best fits your goal. If you're unsure, start with K-means clustering to explore the basic patterns.

    3. **Train the Model**:
        - Once you've selected the algorithm, you can start training the model using the customer segments.
        - The app will automatically preprocess the data, apply the selected algorithm, and present the model results.

    4. **Evaluate the Model**:
        - After training the model, it is important to evaluate its performance. Metrics such as **Accuracy**, **Precision**, **Recall**, and **F1 Score** will be displayed.
        - If the model performs well, you can move forward with deploying it for predictions. If not, you can tweak the parameters or try a different algorithm.

    5. **Interpret the Results**:
        - Once the model has been trained, you'll get the following outputs:
            - **Customer Classifications**: The model will classify customers into predefined segments, such as 'Loyal', 'At-risk', etc.
            - **Feature Importance**: For decision trees and random forests, you'll see which RFM features were most important in predicting customer behavior.
            - **Model Accuracy**: This will help you understand how well the model is performing.

    6. **Make Predictions**:
        - After training and evaluating the model, you can use it to make predictions for new, unseen data. The app will predict the customer segments for the new customers and provide insights.

    # Algorithms and Features

    st.write("""
    - **K-means Clustering**: This algorithm groups similar data points (customers) together into clusters based on RFM features. Itâ€™s useful for uncovering hidden patterns in customer behavior, such as identifying loyal customers or those at risk of churn.
    
    - **Decision Trees**: This algorithm builds a tree-like structure to classify customers based on their RFM scores. Each branch represents a decision rule, and leaves represent the predicted customer category.
    
    - **Random Forest**: Random forest is an extension of decision trees. It builds multiple decision trees and combines their predictions to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting.
    
    - **Logistic Regression**: This is used for binary classification (e.g., predicting whether a customer will buy or not). It estimates the relationship between RFM variables and the likelihood of an event occurring (e.g., a purchase).

    # Model Performance Metrics
    st.header("Model Evaluation Metrics")

    st.write("""
    After training the model, we will display several key metrics to evaluate its performance:
    
    1. **Accuracy**: The percentage of correct predictions made by the model. High accuracy indicates that the model is correctly predicting customer behavior.
    
    2. **Precision**: The proportion of true positive predictions among all positive predictions. Precision is important when you want to minimize false positives (e.g., predicting a loyal customer who is actually at risk).
    
    3. **Recall**: The proportion of true positive predictions among all actual positive cases. Recall is critical when you want to identify as many potential loyal or at-risk customers as possible.
    
    4. **F1 Score**: The harmonic mean of precision and recall. This metric provides a balanced evaluation of the model, especially when you have an imbalanced dataset.
    
    Use these metrics to assess how well your model is predicting customer segments and whether any adjustments need to be made.

    # Conclusion and Next Steps
    st.header("Conclusion and Next Steps")

    st.write("""
    Once you've successfully trained and evaluated your model, you can take the following steps:
    
    1. **Deploy the Model**: Use the model to make predictions on new customer data.
    2. **Fine-Tune the Model**: Adjust parameters or try different algorithms to improve model performance.
    3. **Optimize Marketing Strategies**: Leverage the insights from the model to develop targeted marketing strategies for each customer segment.
    
    The **Modeling** section is a crucial part of the process. By building accurate predictive models, you can make informed decisions about which customers to target with specific marketing campaigns.
