    - **Issue**: The app doesn't load my dataset.
    - **Solution**: Ensure that the dataset is in the correct format (e.g., CSV, Excel). If the issue persists, check the file for any inconsistencies or missing values.
    
    - **Issue**: I can't see the customer segments after performing segmentation.
    - **Solution**: Verify that the dataset contains valid RFM features (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) and that the data is properly preprocessed. Ensure that you are using appropriate segmentation criteria.
    
    - **Issue**: I don't understand the Marketing Strategy suggestions.
    - **Solution**: The app generates strategies based on customer segments. Review the "Customer Insights" and "Segmentation App" sections for a better understanding of the customer groups before applying the marketing strategy.
